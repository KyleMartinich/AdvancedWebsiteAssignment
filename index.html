		<p>Hello, my name is Kyle Martinich and this website is a brief outlook on who I am. I am seventeen years old and am currently a junior at Damien Highschool. At Damien High School, I am the Junior Class Vice President and a member of the Spartan Ambassadors. Along with this, I participate on the Damien soccer team and the tennis team.
